# Cave

I made this in Unity during the first Covid lockdown, and it is far from complete.

The cave is procedurally generated and the player can explore.
By finding a key, they can then open the door to complete the level.

I also started implementing NPCs, but did not complete this.
The NPCs have two bounds (which can be seen from Cheats->Toggle NPC bounds) - one is their detection radius around them,
while the other is the radius around their base that they would be able to move.
However the NPC currently has no logic, and can just be pushed around.

My game demos, including this one, can be played here: [Game Demos](https://games.alexclifton.co.uk)
